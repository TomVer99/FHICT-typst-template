# Contributing to the FHICT (Fontys Hogeschool ICT) Typst Template Project

I'd love your input! I want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Discussing documentation

## Code of Conduct

I am committed to providing a welcoming and inclusive experience for everyone. Please take a moment to read the Code of Conduct [link to Code of Conduct].

## I Develop with Github

I use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## I Use [Github Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-github/github-flow), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (I use [Github Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-github/github-flow)). I actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. Test your changes.
3. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/TomVer99/FHICT-typst-template/issues)

I use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/TomVer99/FHICT-typst-template/issues); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.
